# LOW FODMAP SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE

>A lovely quick take on the traditional Italian pasta dish.   
It's quick to make and tastes amazing too! Nutritional yeast is a 'cheesy' flavoured condiment that is available in all good health food stores. It brings a 'cheesy' taste to this dish, without any of the saturated fat. It's worth having in your press.

### **Instructions**

1. Cook the gluten-free spaghetti as per the instructions on the back of the pack.  
Once cooked, drain and rinse it.
2. Finely chop the greens from the leek.

5. Next, add all the fresh tomatoes, the other tsp of salt, stir well, add the drained and rinsed lentils,  
maple syrup and the red wine and cook for a further 3-4 minutes.
