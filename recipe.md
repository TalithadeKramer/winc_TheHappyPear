# LOW FODMAP SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE

>A lovely quick take on the traditional Italian pasta dish.   
It's quick to make and tastes amazing too! Nutritional yeast is a 'cheesy' flavoured condiment that is available in all good health food stores. It brings a 'cheesy' taste to this dish, without any of the saturated fat. It's worth having in your press.
